# Exercises related to the CVA (Control Value Accessor)

This repository contains the base code for a book store.
There is a server and a frontend.

To start both use **"npm run start"** (see package.json for details).

Starting point for the exercise is the master branch.

There are two sets of other branches with partial and complete solutions for
* Using a CVA to connect a custom drop down input field for a book's genre to a reactive forms model
(branches 1-added-dropdown-component, 2-added-genres-to-dropdown, 3-extended-control-value-accessor)
* Using a CVA to create a sub form for an address (branches nested/...)

Please note that the branches with the rating/ prefix are a separate exercise.
